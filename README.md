## About

The aim of this project is to create all aspects of a website for a restaurant/ diner which allows a customer to place a booking/ reservation.

### Design Thinking

This project will be designed primarily based on the experiences of the main personas I expect to interact with such a site/ booking system;

- The customer

- The restaurant staff

---
#### The Customer

The customer(s) I am primarily concerned with are;

- New customers who are not yet familiar with the restaurant.

- Returning customers who wish to make a booking.

The concerns I have identified for the new customer are;

- confirming the location / name of the restaurant.

- learning about the atmosphere, opening hours, and menu of the restaurant.

- being able to make a booking. *Required project objective*

For returning customers;

- being able to make a booking. *Required project objective*

- being able to navigate past unnecessary/ repeat info.

- being able to contact the restaurant for complaints/ feedback.
---
#### The Restaurant Staff

The restaurant staff I am primarily concered with are;

- The on-shift restaurant staff who will interact directly with customers.

- Managerial staff who will adjust staff hours based on the number of bookings.

The concerns I have identified for the on-shift staff;

- viewing bookings in an immediate and managable format (e.g only show today's/tomorrow's)

- to link bookings with customers (either with a name or a phone-number)

- to add/remove/alter bookings.

- ease of use. (It should be easier that making reservations on paper) *Main concern*

for Managerial staff;

- To see all recorded bookings in one place.

- To see who is working that day (outside project scope)
